// Address is an interface type for any type of destination a transaction
// output may spend to.  This includes pay-to-pubkey (P2PK), pay-to-pubkey-hash
// (P2PKH), and pay-to-script-hash (P2SH).  Address is designed to be generic
// enough that other kinds of addresses may be added in the future without
// changing the decoding and encoding API.
type Address interface {
	// String returns the string encoding of the transaction output
	// destination.
	//
	// Please note that String differs subtly from EncodeAddress: String
	// will return the value as a string without any conversion, while
	// EncodeAddress may convert destination types (for example,
	// converting pubkeys to P2PKH addresses) before encoding as a
	// payment address string.
	String() string

	// EncodeAddress returns the string encoding of the payment address
	// associated with the Address value.  See the comment on String
	// for how this method differs from String.
	EncodeAddress() string

	// ScriptAddress returns the raw bytes of the address to be used
	// when inserting the address into a txout's script.
	ScriptAddress() []byte

	// IsForNet returns whether or not the address is associated with the
	// passed bitcoin network.
	IsForNet(*Params) bool
