// scriptNum represents a numeric value used in the scripting engine with
// special handling to deal with the subtle semantics required by consensus.
//
// All numbers are stored on the data and alternate stacks encoded as little
// endian with a sign bit.  All numeric opcodes such as OP_ADD, OP_SUB,
// and OP_MUL, are only allowed to operate on 4-byte integers in the range
// [-2^31 + 1, 2^31 - 1], however the results of numeric operations may overflow
// and remain valid so long as they are not used as inputs to other numeric
// operations or otherwise interpreted as an integer.
//
// For example, it is possible for OP_ADD to have 2^31 - 1 for its two operands
// resulting 2^32 - 2, which overflows, but is still pushed to the stack as the
// result of the addition.  That value can then be used as input to OP_VERIFY
// which will succeed because the data is being interpreted as a boolean.
// However, if that same value were to be used as input to another numeric
// opcode, such as OP_SUB, it must fail.
//
// This type handles the aforementioned requirements by storing all numeric
// operation results as an int64 to handle overflow and provides the Bytes
// method to get the serialized representation (including values that overflow).
//
// Then, whenever data is interpreted as an integer, it is converted to this
// type by using the makeScriptNum function which will return an error if the
// number is out of range or not minimally encoded depending on parameters.
// Since all numeric opcodes involve pulling data from the stack and
// interpreting it as an integer, it provides the required behavior.
type scriptNum int64

// Bytes returns the number serialized as a little endian with a sign bit.
//
// Example encodings:
//       127 -> [0x7f]
//      -127 -> [0xff]
//       128 -> [0x80 0x00]
//      -128 -> [0x80 0x80]
//       129 -> [0x81 0x00]
//      -129 -> [0x81 0x80]
//       256 -> [0x00 0x01]
//      -256 -> [0x00 0x81]
//     32767 -> [0xff 0x7f]
//    -32767 -> [0xff 0xff]
//     32768 -> [0x00 0x80 0x00]
//    -32768 -> [0x00 0x80 0x80]
